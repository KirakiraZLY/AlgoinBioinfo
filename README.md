# Project 3

## Overview
The implementations are sp_exact_3 and sp_approx.   
sp_exact_3.py computes the scores of 3 sequences in an exact way.   
sp_approx.py computes scores in an appriximating way.   
sp_msa.py computes multiple sequences in an exact way. However, due to the high time complexity, this may not be quite useful, but for fun.

## How to Run
